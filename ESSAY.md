#__The most successful project I did join__

## Project Name : Marvel WOH
## Project description : It's a card game, web base in worl wide market.
## My role : a member of operate team. 
    * I'm a event owner. Take the responsible checking/estimating/developing/deploy event weekly into production base on requirements from BA/ Planners or project manager.
    * I'm also a member of New feature team. Develop new features for game : new kind of event, new kind of battle, new logic in game.
    * I take responsible developing, checking animation (created by Adobe Flash) used in game.

To make it success, I tried to learn the technology used in this game project : CodeIgniter, Smarty, other extension.
Beside, I learned about flash file structure and how the animation lib (in game) convert it into HTML5 and finally I managed to use it.
I deeply know about structure of this game project.


#__The most failure project I did__
## Project Name : Shipplus
## Project description : It's an application connecting stores with shipping services.
## My role : manager, designer, developer.
    * I and my friends brainstorm the idea, design the system, flow of application.
    * I write the flow of application, use-cases, manage UI / UX
    * I develop backend, write api. 

I finally publish application to production but it's not a fully product as we designed because :

 - My team war broken because of personal issue.

The thing above I did not estimate. I did not have plan B, C.

So the lesson I did learn :
 - Manpower is the most difficult element in management.
 - In the later of development timeline, mesure the product is under estimated, right direction is the most important thing.
 - Alway have plan B, C for everything even the thing may never change.
